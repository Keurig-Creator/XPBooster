# ROUND-NUMBER OPTION
# If 'rounding' is set to 'ROUND', this specifies the threshold for rounding.
# Example: if round-number is 0.5:
#          - 2.5 will round to 3
#          - 2.4 will round to 2
# Adjust this value to change the rounding threshold.
round-decimal: 0.5

# Range the multiplier will use. Keep in mind the multiplier will be rounded because of how Minecraft stores the experience.
# For example, if set to true, you can have a full range including the decimal point for the multiplier.
